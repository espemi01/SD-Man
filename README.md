# SD-Man
A simple Swift app built for the Luther College Digital Media Center to make sure that student works are not lost.

* After FAR too many moments where we thought someones project was gone, and even a few times when the media was truely gone I set out to create an easy to use quickly deployable solution to fix the issue.
* I decided on Swift because most of the computers in the lab and the workstations in the studio for tethered caputer are Macs.
* I intend on building another version for our Windows workstations in C# to practice and get more experience developing for Windows and becuase the lab will soon be switching to Windows machines.
* I intend to keep this app fairly generic so it can be shipped to the app store and be used by anyone needing to offload device media to an SMB Share regularly with bullet proof organization and automated permissions.
